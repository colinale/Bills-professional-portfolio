        <p>
          Hello and thank you for visiting Colin Alexander's portfolio! While visiting this site you're going to learn a little bit 
          about myself and see some of my work. I am originally from central New York and then made my way over to Buffalo New York
          to attend SUNY, University at Buffalo in which I received a Bachelors of Science in Financial Analysis.
        </p>
        <p>
          I played football
          for the university my freshman year and then left to join the rugby team. I'm also part of the business fraternity, Alpha
          Kappa Psi and was the presdient my senior year. After college I found myself in Charlotte North Carolina working a couple of
          banking jobs. Although I have enjoyed the work, I wanted something new, challenging, and rewarding. That's what landed me
          at University of North Carolina at Chappel Hill to study their Full Stack Development program. Since you've made it this far,
          feel free to check out my portfolio and reach out to me with any questions. Thank you!
        </p>
